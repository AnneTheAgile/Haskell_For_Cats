haskell_For_Cats:

Because programming is hard and cats are busy!
=============
The plan is to do thirteen weeks of Haskell 
	from the beginning . . .  
		using Graham Hutton's Book Programming Haskell  
		and Erik Meijer's Video series Functional Programming in Haskell 
			which mirrors the above mentioned book.
 
	This will be for those that have never programmed before 
	but also for those who have programmed in other languages and paradigms
		(namely O.O.P. and pocedural and/or iterative)  
		but are new to the functional approach.

---------------------------------------------	

	Why Haskell? 

	Because it's fast: 
		(out of the box), as fast as Java and a whole lot cleaner,
			and (with some tweaking) it can be as fast as C++ but with a lower error rate.
	
	Because Haskell will scale, presently to 40+ cores on one machine. 
			Most other languages will choke on a faction of that load.  
	
	Because it is terse and concise: 
		Less lines of code usually = less bugs. 
			The stats are 1.4 bugs per 100 lines of code requardless of the language.
		
	Because it is strongly typed:
		Strong typing reduces mismatch errors. 
			If some idiot can, some idiot will; 
				and late at night and/or after n beers that idiot might be you.
				
	Because Haskell is faster to working code. 
		Once Haskell has compiled you are more than half the way done.

	Because there is less to test. 
		Pure functions, reduce your testing surface. 
			Same imputs yeild same results regardless of context. 
				Immutability, means less shared memory. 
					Haskell is thus less fragile.  

	Haskell has a direct connection to Lambda Calculus; it strives for mathmatical purity. 
		In Haskell: mathmatics and computer science converge here rather than lock horns.

---------------------------
		
	Where would you use it?
	
	Anywhere you need: 
		big compute, 
		pattern matching, 
		multi core concurrency.  
	
	And you can use it in addition to other languages, to and strength where you need it. 


	These are just some of the reasons, there are more, but this will do for openers.
